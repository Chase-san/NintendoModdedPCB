# DMG-A02-01

This board is used by german versions of Pokemon Red/Blue, as well as Pokemon Yellow, Pokemon Trading Card Game, and Link's Awakening DX.

The original featured cut holes that were used for debugging purposes, these have been omitted.

This particular board was based on the outlines taken from HDR boards, however all routes and footprints have been changed to more directly reflect the original board.
